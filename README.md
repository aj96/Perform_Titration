# Perform_Titration

Synopsis
--------

About titration: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration

This program allows the user to calculate the pH of a solution after adding some liters of titrant. It also allows the user to calculate how many liters of the titrant are needed to reach the equivalence point. Please note that the program cannot accept numbers in scientific notation.

A pdf in this repository is provided to show an example of how a Titration problem is solved by hand. Problem 16 in the pdf involves titrating an acid with a base. Cyanic Acid is the initial solution, and Rubidium Hydorixde is the titrant. 

pKa is 3.66 which yields a Ka of: 0.000219

Molarity of Titrant: 0.2

Molarity of Initial Solution: 0.2

Volume of Initial Solution: 0.025

You can solve parts b, c, and d of problem 16 using this program. Part b is before the equivalence point; part c is at the equivalence point; and part d is after the equivalence point.

Motivation
----------

In chemistry class, solving for pH by hand, using ICE tables and sometimes having to solve the quadratic formula was a pain. You also had to take one of three different mathematical approaches depending on if you were before the quivalence point, at the equivalence point, or after the equivalence point. So I wrote this program to do it all for me.

Installation
------------

You can run this program in IDLE or you can run it from the command line:

Command:

$ python Perform_Titration.py
